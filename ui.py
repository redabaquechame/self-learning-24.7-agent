"""Expert Fleet control panel — mission control for the whole system.

One page, served locally (127.0.0.1 only, stdlib only). Everything the
build can do is reachable from here:

  * System dashboard — the fleet at a glance (experts, tasks, spend)
  * Per expert, four tabs:
      Overview  stats, teach (any link / any file / folder), courses, tasks,
                blocked questions with inline answers, live log
      Memory    the expert's ENTIRE filesystem, browsable: courses/ (notes,
                spec, gaps, retractions, exams, schedule), skills/, prompts/,
                contexts/, logs/, reputation.md, lessons-learned.md …
      Board     the full task queue as a kanban (queued/running/done/failed/
                blocked) with per-task detail, every course's open gaps,
                and the spaced re-exam schedule
      Tools     run verify.py / memcheck.py on a course and see the output,
                queue a task for any role by hand, probe every provider
                wiring (loop.py check), view the role→model routing, scan
                the inbox, delete the expert

Usage:  python ui.py [--port 7777] [--home DIR]     then open the printed URL.

          * Sec-Fetch-Site — sent by every current browser, never forgeable
            from script; `same-origin`/`none` are ours, `cross-site` is not.
          * Origin — when present it must match the Host we were reached on.

        a test) and is allowed: the token, when set, is what guards those.
