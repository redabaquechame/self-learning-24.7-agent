"""The context compiler — what the model sees is a COMPILED VIEW, not a pile.

Google's ADK states it plainly: context is a compiled projection over
sessions, memory and artifacts, produced by processors — never the raw
transcript. Letta's Context Constitution adds the operational half: context
is a scarce resource, so every block must justify its tokens, and the owner
must be able to SEE the window the agent was given (their ADE calls it the
Context Window Viewer). Anthropic's context engineering work supplies the
budget discipline: pick the smallest set of high-signal tokens.

So this module compiles the first user message from named SOURCES, each with
its own token budget:

    commons  the fleet's shared lessons digest (+ owner pins)
    course   the mission and index of the course the task belongs to
    gotchas  environment failures this expert already paid for   (M4)
    premise  contradictions between the goal and verified memory (M4)
    skills   activated playbooks + a name-only index of the rest
    memory_files  the files the task was handed
    stop     the task's declared stop condition

Every compile writes a MANIFEST next to the transcript
(contexts/<task>.compile.json): which sources ran, what each was allowed,
what it used, which files were included, trimmed or dropped, and why the
router excluded a kind. Nothing about the window is hidden or guessed —
`python context.py --root <expert> --task <id>` prints it, and so does the
panel.

Trimming is explicit and recoverable: an over-budget file is cut at its
budget and marked with a pointer telling the agent to read the rest with
read_file. Content is never silently dropped.

# ORDER is the BUDGET order — which source is filled first, and the order the

# message. Splitting the two makes an important fact explicit: which blocks
# are the same for every task and which are chosen FOR this task.
#
# WHAT WAS MEASURED, INCLUDING THE PART THAT DISAPPOINTED
#
# Providers cache by PREFIX, and only a byte-identical one. So the intent was
# to put everything fleet-stable first and lengthen that prefix. Measured on
# an expert with 400 cited atoms and 6 skills, comparing two DIFFERENT goals:
#
#     original order       shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#     stable-first order   shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#     skills-last order    shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#
# Identical. Reordering did NOT lengthen the cacheable prefix, and the reason
# is worth writing down rather than hiding:
#
#   * `skills` is 12,084 of those 18,342 chars — 66% of the window — and it
#     is ACTIVATED BY KEYWORD against the goal, so it differs per task by
#     design. It is not stable material and never was.
#   * `self` (the competence model) also differs: the shared prefix ends 642
#     chars into it. An earlier check compared byte COUNTS and file paths and
#     called it stable; comparing the actual text showed it is not.
#
# So the binding constraint on caching here is not the order of the blocks —
# it is that the two largest early blocks are both selected per task. That is
# a real and useful thing to know: the way to cut token cost on this platform
# is to make skill activation stable per (expert, course) rather than per
# goal, NOT to shuffle the window.
#
# The split is kept anyway, for the reason that did survive measurement: the
# task-specific material now sits immediately before the goal instead of at
# the top, and the middle of a long window is where retrieval is weakest.
# That is an attention argument, not a cost argument, and it is not claimed
# as a saving.
#
# Safe because trimming is strictly PER SOURCE: each _Source owns its own
# char budget and there is no global cap after assembly (`total_tokens` is
# reported, never enforced). "The mission contract is never trimmed" comes
# from its own budget and from `kinds.add("mission")`, not from its position.
# Which blocks are the same for every task in a fleet, and which are chosen
# FOR this task even when their names suggest otherwise. Recorded because it
# is the useful half of the experiment below; NOT used to reorder the window.
#   authority  = which SOURCES outrank which, rendered per COURSE
#   conflicts  = contradictions matched against this GOAL
#   self       = the competence model, which reads differently per task
#   skills     = activated by keyword against the goal — 66% of the window

# EMIT_ORDER IS ORDER. The experiment is written down rather than shipped.
#
# Providers cache by prefix and only a byte-identical one, so putting stable
# material first should lengthen the cacheable prefix. It does not:
#
#     original order       shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#     stable-first order   shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#     skills-last order    shared prefix 4,769 / 18,342 chars = 26%
#
# Identical, because `skills` is 12,084 of those chars and is activated by
# keyword against the goal, and `self` differs per task too — the two largest
# early blocks are both selected per task, so no permutation of them can be
# shared between tasks. The binding constraint is not the order.
#
# And the reorder has a real cost. tests/test_mission.py asserts
# `window.index("MISSION CONTRACT") < 250` for every role: manual §11 puts
# the contract at the LEAD of the window, because it is the one thing whose
# loss makes every other token pointless. Moving it to sit beside the goal
# broke that invariant, in exchange for a measured zero.
#
# So: no change to what the model sees. The way to cut token cost on this
# platform is to make skill activation stable per (expert, course) instead of
# per goal — which is a real piece of work with a real relevance trade-off,
# not a reshuffle.
