"""THE PROOF SYSTEM — "finished" is a derived status, never a claim.

Manual §23: proof levels 0–5, a required Proof Pack per subsystem change, and
the rule that decides everything else here:

    "No engineer is allowed to change a status to Finished manually.
     The status is derived from evidence."
    "A developer cannot set proof status manually; the UI reads generated
     proof manifests. Any regression or expired live check downgrades the
     badge automatically."

So a feature does not carry a status field. It carries a CONTRACT — what the
user can now do, the invariants that must hold, the tests that hold them, and
the commands that reproduce them — and the level is computed from evidence
that exists on disk right now:

    0 SPEC                requirements written, no implementation
    1 IMPLEMENTED         the code path exists
    2 OFFLINE VERIFIED    its acceptance tests pass in controlled fixtures
    3 LIVE VERIFIED       the real external dependency path was exercised
    4 STRESS VERIFIED     alternate paths, failure, restart, concurrency,
                          security and budget were tested
    5 PRODUCTION PROVEN   sustained real workload met declared thresholds

Two rules keep this honest, and they are the whole point:

  * evidence EXPIRES. A live check from six months ago proves the path worked
    six months ago. `live_max_age_days` downgrades it automatically, so a
    badge cannot rot into a lie by sitting still.
  * evidence is BOUND TO CODE. Each observation records the hash of the files
    it covers. Change the code and the observation no longer describes it, so
    the level drops until the evidence is regenerated. This is what makes a
    regression downgrade a badge without anyone remembering to do it.

`REGISTRY` is the declared contract for every subsystem. `evaluate()` reads
the ledger and returns the level each one has EARNED. Nothing writes a level.
