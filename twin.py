"""THE TWIN — a Self Kernel of the OWNER, beneath every agent.

docs/DESIGN-P10-twin.md, in one paragraph: `selfmodel.py` tells an agent
what IT has verified; this module tells the fleet how the PERSON it works
for actually decides — learned from that person's own decisions, scored in
shadow against the decisions they make later, honest about where it does
not know, and versioned when the person changes. Two layers, never mixed:

  THE CLONE       predict(): what would the owner do here — an estimated
                  distribution over the options, the features that drove
                  it, a novelty score, and an "ask for more information"
                  mass. Three arms: a conditional-logit fit over declared
                  features, behavioral programs mined from the episodes
                  (candidate → supported on validation rows), and the nearest
                  past episodes. Everything mechanical; no model call.
  THE SUPER-SELF  superself(): the same identity, standards and objectives,
                  handed a model and the platform's augmentation, asked what
                  the owner would do with more to know — and where that
                  DIVERGES from the clone, a policy-update question to the
                  owner. The kernel is never moved by the Super-Self.

The disciplines, each a test in tests/test_twin.py:

  * twin/ is CONTROL — the worker can read the owner's model and can never
    write it (a worker that could would author its own owner).
  * consent is a sealed chain under learning_authority (owner-only,
    first-seal-wins); scopes nest predict < advise < draft < act; without a
    verified grant every function refuses with the reason; revoke returns
    to refusal. `act` never executes: it queues a gated task, and a task
    with no definition of done is refused.
  * shadow predictions are sealed (hashed) BEFORE the owner decides and
    hidden until the decision lands — a shown prediction contaminates the
    signal it is measured against.
  * a question is asked only at a high-information point (a confident
    miss or a novel decision without a note), one open at a time.
  * drift is a NOTICE with numbers and a question; a kernel version changes
    only when the owner confirms.
  * every output carries the label. Not a prompt string — a field.
