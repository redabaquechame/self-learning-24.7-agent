"""FILE AUTHORITY — one gateway for every model-influenced filesystem path.

Manual §19: *"File Authority — every caller must use it for any read/write
using an external or model-influenced path; mandatory controls: canonicalize;
containment; protected roots; symlink/junction checks; atomic write; trace."*
Manual §25.4: *"Separate agent-writable workspace from protected control
state and route all filesystem operations through File Authority."*

The audit found `_safe_path` guarding exactly two call sites while five
harness writers built `courses/<course>/…` paths from an unsanitised value —
one of which was shown writing outside the expert root entirely. The lesson
is the same one the Execution Authority answers: a control that lives at a
call site protects that call site and nothing else.

So containment is a typed ZONE, not a per-caller check:

    WORKSPACE   the agent's own work: courses, out, artifacts, answers,
                skills, teamwork, consults, goals, research, gotchas, cases
                -> agent may read and write
    CONTROL     what decides what the agent may do: settings.toml, mcp.json,
                prompts/, approvals/, variants/, state.json, prospective.json,
                effects.jsonl, the skill graph
                -> agent may READ some, may never write
    SECRET      credentials, by the one credential model
                -> never readable, never writable, never packaged
    RUNTIME     logs, contexts, checkpoints, events
                -> harness writes; agent does not

`resolve()` is the single function. It canonicalises, refuses traversal,
refuses symlinks and NTFS junctions that leave the root, classifies the zone
and enforces the zone's rule. `write_text()` adds atomic replacement so a
crash mid-write cannot leave a half-file where a whole one was.
