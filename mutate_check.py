"""MUTATION TESTING — break the feature, confirm the test notices.

A passing test proves nothing on its own: a test that would pass with the
feature removed is a test that measures nothing. This deliberately breaks
each load-bearing behaviour and requires the test that claims to cover it to
FAIL. Every mutation is reverted afterwards.

    — so the guard correctly detected a real agent.env, announced that it was
    SKIPPING to avoid touching it, and then deleted it on the way out.
    Running `python mutate_check.py` destroyed the operator's API keys
    silently, while reporting a skip. Found when a real agent.env vanished
    from this working tree mid-session and the deletion was traced here.

    A name that means "ours" cannot be assigned before we know it is ours.
