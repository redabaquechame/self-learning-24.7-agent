"""The Commons — shared memory for the whole fleet, plus peer consultation.

Every expert keeps its own private mind (courses, notes, skills). The
commons is what they know TOGETHER:

  commons/knowledge/<topic>.md   facts contributed by any expert, each line
                                 attributed and citing its origin
  commons/lessons.md             what the fleet learned from its MISTAKES —
                                 every failure that cost work, written once so
                                 no expert repeats it
  commons/directory.md           who knows what: the live roster of experts
                                 and their specialties, so an agent knows whom
                                 to ask

Rules that keep shared memory from rotting into a rumor mill:
  * append-only and attributed — every entry names the expert and the date
  * claims carry their origin (a course atom, a file, or a verified run)
  * anything contradicted later is struck through, never silently deleted
  * agents READ the commons in context; they WRITE via this module's API,
    which stamps attribution automatically

Peer consultation: an expert can ask another expert a question — the answer
comes back through the peer's own citation-gated consultation flow, so a
borrowed answer is as grounded as a first-hand one.

Usage:
  python commons.py show [--home DIR]
  python commons.py learn "lesson text" --from <expert> [--tag t]
  python commons.py note <topic> "fact" --from <expert> [--src "..."]
  python commons.py ask <expert> "question" --from <asker> [--home DIR] [--wait]

    rewriting the whole document.

    So `lessons.md` stays the ledger (nothing is ever edited or deleted

    lessons merged into one line carrying every contributor and a hit count,

    the curation itself is auditable and reversible — delete the view and it
