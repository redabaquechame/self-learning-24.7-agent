"""EVIDENCE — why we believe each system works, and where belief runs out.

"All tests passed" is not a claim about the platform. It is a claim about the
tests. This module turns the first into the second honestly: it runs the
suite, captures what each test SAID it proved (every test prints its own
`[section]` sentences), maps those to the six systems, and writes a report
where each system carries:

    verdict     proven / proven except skipped / partly proven /
                FAILING / UNPROVEN
    evidence    the sentences the tests actually printed, from this run
    blind spot  what these tests do not cover, stated plainly

The last column is the point. A system with twelve passing tests and one
untested failure mode is not "green" — it is well covered with a named hole,
and an owner deciding whether to trust it deserves the hole.

Two rules keep it honest:

  * every registered test must be assigned to a system. A new test that
    nobody classified makes this report fail loudly, so coverage cannot
    silently drift away from the map.
  * a system with no tests is printed as UNPROVEN in capitals. Silence is
    never read as success.
  * a test that SKIPS is a third outcome, not a failure and not a proof. It
    is named in the report with the reason it gave, it contributes no
    observations, and a system where everything skipped reads UNPROVEN.

    python evidence.py                 # run the suite and write EVIDENCE.md
    python evidence.py --from run.log  # use a captured run instead

    headers and each child's stdout/stderr flush independently, so a

    the inverse of the UNITTEST_OK_RE bug, and just as corrosive: a report
    that can cry wolf teaches its reader to ignore wolves.

    run_all's tail is authoritative — it counts EXIT CODES and names every
    failed file in a `FAILED: <name>` line. So when that tail is present,
    a test with no recognized pass marker and no skip is failed ONLY if
    the tail names it; otherwise its verdict is the exit code's (passed)
