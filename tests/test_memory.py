"""The memory institution: the categories that outlive models and agents.

1. FAILURES are structured and self-classifying: the harness's own error text
   determines the category (no model guesses), identical failures increment a
   recurrence count instead of duplicating, and the record survives the fix.
2. COMPETENCE is earned from verified outcomes, never self-reported: gated
   work counts double, tiny samples are labelled as such, and 'who should do
   this' is answerable from evidence.
3. RETIREMENT preserves everything — a retired agent's whole world stays
   queryable and restorable; only an explicit purge destroys it.
4. THE MAP indexes living and retired agents together.
5. SEARCH is hybrid: structured filters first, ranked text second.
6. The loop files all of this automatically when a task ends.

Run from the agent/ directory:  python tests/test_memory.py
