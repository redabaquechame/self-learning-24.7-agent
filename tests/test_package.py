"""THE SHIPPED ARCHIVE MUST NOT CARRY WHAT IT PROMISES TO LEAVE BEHIND.

`package.py` and `evidence.py` were the last two modules no test mentioned.
That mattered unevenly: `evidence.py` writing a wrong report is embarrassing,
and `package.py` shipping a key is a disclosed credential. A distributable
archive is the most-copied artefact this project produces — it goes to people
who were never told what not to look at.

So the checks here are the ones whose failure is expensive:

  1. the archive contains NO credential, by name, by extension, or by
     content — including the four sources `credentials.py` knows about
  2. it contains no expert memory, no task state, no logs, no contexts
  3. it DOES contain everything needed to run: the modules, the prompts, the
     tests, and settings.toml
  4. an archive with a secret in it is refused rather than shipped
  5. it unzips into a directory that immediately passes `harness --check`
  6. `evidence.py` names every registered test and refuses to invent a
     verdict for a system whose tests never ran
