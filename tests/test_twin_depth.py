"""Phase 10.1 exit benchmark — twin depth, held green.

docs/DESIGN-P10.1-twin-depth.md preregistered exactly this:

  1. CAPTURE       panel audit rows, a named history file and a named
                   directory produce events exactly once; a command with a
                   key-shaped token is stored redacted; an edit stores
                   counts, never content; nothing named -> nothing captured
  2. ROUTINES      a habit in the command stream is mined as a routine;
                   held-out next-act accuracy beats the majority baseline;
                   the OWNER block carries the workflow line
  3. COLD START    interview answers land in the kernel and the block; 24
                   vignettes answered by a known policy fit a kernel; a
                   re-answer is a retest and measures self-consistency
  4. OBJECTIVES    a mission and a goal appear in objectives() and the
                   block; predict(at=) cites only earlier episodes and
                   reports what was knowable
  5. AUGMENTATION  three scripted lenses aggregate by vote with evidence
                   and a disputed assumption; three calls metered; the
                   simulation reports stability and a flip point; the
                   divergence queues a question; the kernel does not move
  6. BENCHMARK     attention, preference, temporal (the era version wins
                   after a confirmed drift), outcome and workflow fidelity
                   are reported; without data each says not measured
  7. SIGNATURES    with a key every output verifies; a tampered body
                   fails; without a key outputs say unsigned
  8. ALTERNATIVES  consider() returns the options weighed in similar
                   situations; history() lists versions, drifts, interview
  9. REGISTRATION  run_all, evidence, proof, doctor, leakage, REFERENCE,
                   MANUAL, settings
