"""PROMOTION LEAKAGE — can any worker-writable path define success or
earned trust? Asked permanently, of every such path, by name.

The platform's central safety rule is

    experience -> CANDIDATE -> fresh independent evaluation -> PROVEN

so every file that records a verdict, a seal, a trust status, a proof
observation, an evaluation suite or an authority grant must be out of the
worker's reach. The 2026-09-02 consolidated audit asked for this to become
a dedicated suite rather than a one-time sweep (docs/DESIGN-P6.1, finding
11). For each path two things are checked:

  static    fileauth.zone_of classifies it CONTROL or RUNTIME — never
            workspace; the module-computed seal paths must resolve outside
            the root or under a CONTROL zone inside it (org/);
  dynamic   fileauth.resolve(root, path, "write", "agent") REFUSES it, while
            the harness actor is still allowed through (the ledgers must be
            writable by the platform, or nothing could ever be recorded).

The path constants the modules actually use are pinned to the enumeration,
so a renamed ledger cannot slip out of it. A new ledger that lands in a
workspace zone fails here with its name and what it decides.

First run found one: proof/observations.jsonl — the ledger proof.evaluate
derives every proof LEVEL from — sat in the agent's proof/ workspace.

Run from the agent/ directory:  python tests/test_promotion_leakage.py
