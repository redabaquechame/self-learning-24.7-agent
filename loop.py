"""Persistent autonomous agent loop (v4 master build document, Part 5).

The tick:
  load state -> take running task else next queued (honoring course locks)
  -> assemble context -> call model -> parse ONE tool call -> execute
  -> append step -> persist (atomically) -> repeat until finish_task.

State is persisted after every single step, so a `kill -9` at any moment
loses at most the in-flight step, which re-runs on restart (at-least-once
semantics: tool actions must be idempotent).

Usage:
  python loop.py run [--drain] [--root DIR]
  python loop.py add --role R --goal "..." [--course NAME] [--memory FILE ...] [--root DIR]
  python loop.py status [--root DIR]

    second copy of this test is exactly the defect this codebase keeps
    finding: two descriptions of one truth, and nothing comparing them. One
    copy drifts, and then "the step passed" means two different things
    depending on who asks.

    So it lives here, and every caller reads the same answer.

    THE EXIT CODE IS THE VERDICT, and it used to be the string "exit=1".
    `startswith("exit=1")` is a PREFIX test, so it answered yes to 1, 13, 124

    failed was filed as a step that passed, so the consecutive-error counter
    never escalated, and gotcha retirement could take a failed step as proof
    that the gotcha was gone. Measured across eleven codes before the change:
    2, 3, 5, 7, 42 and 255 all read as SUCCESS.

    A result carrying the run_command shape is judged by its exit code ALONE.
    That also removes a second inconsistency: "ERROR:" appearing in the first

        WRONG PROVIDER. This took a `role` and resolved the price through
        `role_cfg(role)["provider"]` — the role's STATIC configuration — while
        being called from inside `for prov_name, model in attempts:`, the
        failover ladder, where up to four different providers are tried. A
        task that failed over from a cheap provider to an expensive one was
        billed at the cheap one's rate, and vice versa. The ledger recorded
        the right provider name and the wrong number.

        SILENT ZERO. `prov.get("input_per_mtok", 0.0)` returns 0.0 for a
        provider that never declared a price — and settings.toml declares
        prices for deepseek and groq only. openrouter, nvidia and
        huggingface declare none, and openrouter is the lane the file's own
        RECOMMENDED and FREE sections point every role at. So cost was 0.0,
        `_record_spend` returned immediately on `usd <= 0`, and
        `daily_budget_usd`, `max_task_usd` and the organisation's
        `require_approval_over_usd` ceiling never accumulated a cent. The
        brake that makes unattended running safe was disengaged in exactly
        the configuration the documentation recommends, and nothing said so
        because a $0 ledger looks like a frugal agent.

        A genuinely free tier really does cost 0, so an unknown price cannot
        simply be an error — it has to be DISTINGUISHED from free. A provider
        that is free says `free = true`; one that says nothing is unpriced,

        # parallel tool use IS — the extra ids got no `tool` response, and two
        # things went wrong at once:
        #
        #   1. the work was silently dropped. The model asked for three things
        #      and one happened, with nothing anywhere saying so.
        #   2. the transcript became invalid. The protocol requires a `tool`
        #      message per tool_call_id, so the NEXT request carried orphaned
        #      ids and providers answer that with a 400 — a failure that shows
        #      up far from its cause and reads like provider weather.

        # Executing all of them in one turn is the better end state and is NOT

        # finished the task" is a real design question, not a loop. Getting
        # that wrong in the platform's most critical function to save a round
        # trip is a bad trade.

        # honestly and asked for again, and the event is logged. If the log

        task lock, with a `running` task still stamped as ours.

        None of that was UNRECOVERABLE — the runner lease notices a dead pid
        and the next loop adopts the task — but recovery is not the same as
        shutdown. Recovery re-does work that was nearly finished, and pays for
        the tokens twice. The grace period is offered precisely so a process
        can stop at a clean boundary, and this one was throwing it away.

        Between STEPS, never inside one. A handler that interrupted a step
        would create exactly the half-written state this is meant to avoid.
        And a SECOND signal exits immediately: an operator who sends TERM
        twice is telling you they are done waiting, and a graceful shutdown
