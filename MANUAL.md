# Expert Fleet — the manual

A file-backed, stdlib-only platform for building expert AI agents that work
24/7, prove what they did, and remember what they learned. No database, no
framework, no build step: Python 3.11+ and your own API keys.

Everything below is real behaviour of the code in this folder. Where a claim
could rot, the test that keeps it honest is named.

For the deep version — every system explained end to end, the loop and the
harness in detail, all the logic, and an honest list of what the platform
does **not** do — see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

---

## 1. Run it today

```
python bootstrap.py
```

That one command creates `agent.env`, tells you exactly what is missing
(numbered, with the fix), creates your first expert, starts the control panel
and opens it. It is idempotent: run it again any time.

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--key NAME=VALUE` | writes a provider key into `agent.env`. The value is never printed, never logged, never in the report. |
| `--expert "Name" --identity "..."` | names the first expert |
| `--teach <url-or-folder>` | hands that expert its first material immediately |
| `--offline` | skip live provider probes (no network) |
| `--start-loop` | also start the expert's 24/7 loop |
| `--no-panel` / `--port` / `--host` / `--token` | control the panel |
| `--json` | machine-readable output (also written to `bootstrap.json`) |

Exit code `0` = ready. Exit code `2` = blocked, and stdout is the numbered
list of what to do. (`tests/test_bootstrap.py`)

**Keys.** Put them in `agent.env` beside this file — one `NAME=VALUE` per
line. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, and optionally `E2B_API_KEY` /
`DAYTONA_API_KEY` for hosted sandboxes. Set spend caps at every provider
before first use.

**Health at any time:** `python doctor.py` (ends with a verdict and a
`[readiness]` section), `python harness.py --check` (exit 0 = every contract
holds).

---

## 2. What the platform is

Six systems, each with its own module set:

| # | system | modules |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Harness & loop** — context, tools, gates, brakes, retries, policy, effects, compaction | `loop.py` `harness.py` `policy.py` `effects.py` `locks.py` `checkpoint.py` `sandbox.py` |
| 2 | **Fleet & creation lanes** — trained, quick, archetype, learner, team | `fleet.py` `quick.py` `templates.py` `team.py` |
| 3 | **Work systems** — task, goal engine, workflow, consultation, intentions, routines | `goal.py` `workflows.py` `consult.py` `prospective.py` `routines.py` |
| 4 | **Memory institution** — courses, skills, commons, failures, gotchas, premise, routing, recall | `memory.py` `skills.py` `commons.py` `recall.py` `gotchas.py` `premise.py` `memrouter.py` `context.py` |
| 5 | **Improvement & governance** — variants with predictions, approvals, replay, benchmark | `variants.py` `approvals.py` `replay.py` `benchmark.py` |
| 6 | **Control plane & interop** — panel, chief, doctor, providers, toolbox, MCP, A2A, traces, cards | `ui.py` `ui.html` `chief.py` `doctor.py` `providers.py` `toolbox.py` `mcp.py` `federation.py` `trace.py` `uicards.py` `modelrouter.py` |

Underneath all six sit the **six authorities** — one mandatory gateway per
kind of power, so a control cannot defend only the path its author happened to
be thinking about:

| Authority | Module | Every caller must pass it to… |
|---|---|---|
| Execution | `execution.py` (+ `policy.py`, `sandbox.py`) | run a process |
| File | `fileauth.py` | read or write a path |
| Credential | `credentials.py` | resolve a secret |
| Model gateway | `modelgateway.py` | make a provider call |
| Effect | `effects.py` | do something with an outside consequence |
| Control plane | `controlplane.py` | change what the agent is allowed to do |

The last one exists because an external audit found the invariant that spans
two of the others owned by neither. `fileauth` refuses the `write_file` tool
on control state and `policy` screens a command string — so a role that
legitimately holds `run_command` could rewrite `settings.toml`, `prompts/`
and `approvals/` by running a program, untouched by either gate. Measured on
the shipped default, through a real practitioner task. `controlplane.py`
brackets every model-authored execution: on `sandbox = "docker"` the control
paths are bound read-only and the write is *prevented* by the kernel; on the
default `host` backend, where there is no filesystem boundary to prevent
with, the change is *reverted*, the command is reported failed whatever it
exited with, and the attempt lands in `logs/controlplane.jsonl`.

…plus the systems that decide whether any of it can be believed: `proof.py`
(capability levels 0–5, derived from evidence bound to a code hash),
`mission.py` (the objective held outside the transcript), `workers.py` (where
work runs), `acquire.py` (how a capability is gained), `org.py` (who may do
what) and `training.py` (what may be promoted).

---

## 3. The panel

`python ui.py` (or let `bootstrap.py` start it) → http://127.0.0.1:7777

Six sections, named for **jobs, not architecture** — the interface no longer
asks you to learn the implementation map before getting work done:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Home** | start work and see what needs attention |
| **Work** | everything being done |
| **Agents** | create and manage intelligence |
| **Resources** | what agents know and can use |
| **Proof** | evidence and quality |
| **Admin** | infrastructure and policy |

Nothing was removed to get there. Memory became *Resources → Knowledge*,
Models and System became *Admin* tabs, and Guide became contextual help
reachable from the ⌘K palette. `tests/test_frontend.py` asserts that each
one is still routed **and** still reachable from something a person can click.

- **Home** — a command bar (*"What do you want accomplished?"*) and four
  primary actions: **New mission · Create specialist · Build team · Connect
  tool or computer**. Below it: **active work** (objective, progress against
  its criteria, current action, cost, next blocker), **needs you**, **recently
  completed** with its proof, a one-line platform-health verdict, *Today*
  ranked from real state, and the **live pulse** — a server-sent event stream,
  not polling.
  A **first-10-minutes checklist** sits on top until it is done; its seven
  steps read real state, so creating an agent from the terminal ticks the box
  just as well.
- **Agents** — the roster, and a creation wizard that asks **what you need**
  rather than which of the five lanes you want. Five intent questions map
  invisibly to the lanes, then six steps (Job · Knowledge · Access · Quality ·
  Cost · Review) end in a plain-language summary of what the agent will be able
  to know, do, spend and change.
  Opening one gives *Overview · Work · Knowledge · Skills · Performance ·
  Access · Advanced*, with a **teammate rail**.
  - **Work** — every task, with its **stop condition**, resumable checkpoint
    progress, the **context window** it was given, its **trace**, any **cards**
    it returned, and *save as routine*. A failed row says which part failed —
    the verifier, the platform, the provider, the budget, the command, the
    agent, or you — and what happens next.
  - **Knowledge** — the **certification record**: sources by authority,
    requirements covered over requirements required, open gaps, lessons written
    up, the exam score and whether it was closed-book. No percentage is ever
    printed without its denominator.
  - **Performance** — verified success, false success, the case ledger, cost by
    purpose, which model actually works for *this* agent (with the sample size),
    tool error rates, and which computers its work ran on.
  - **Advanced** — *Identity & prompts* (edit `identity.md`, previous versions
    kept, plus the fleet-wide **owner pins**), *Models & compute*, and the
    **raw file tree**.
- **Work** — missions, goals (with the plan and its CHECK commands visible),
  teams readable as **threads** (brief → plan → each deliverable → synthesis),
  and workflows drawn as **pipelines** with their gates.
  A **mission page** is the centre of the product: the objective and its
  contract fingerprint, the success-criteria checklist with the evidence behind
  each met one, binding constraints, explicit non-goals, *Needs you* separated
  from *Blocked on*, and the contract exactly as the agent sees it under
  Advanced.
- **Resources** — **Computers** (zone, capability, cost, scale-to-zero, who may
  use each), **Tools**, **Knowledge** (the fleet map, failures, competence,
  retired agents) and **Skills**.
- **Proof** — *Work proof* (every mission's criteria and their evidence) and
  *Platform proof* (20 capabilities, each with its level 0–5, the reason,
  the invariants, the code hash the evidence is bound to, and the exact command
  that reproduces it). **No endpoint can set a level.**
- **Admin** — *Health* (doctor, harness manifest, pulses, tool error rates,
  routines, federation, remote access), *Models & cost* (the policy chooser:
  Cheapest · Balanced · Highest quality · Custom, plus providers, catalogue and
  charter variants), *People* (roles and the audit trail), *Audit*, *Training
  lab* and *Backup & release*.

**Several people?** `python org.py create "Acme" --owner you@example.com`
turns on roles and an attributable audit trail. Each member gets a personal
panel token (`python org.py token <email> --as you@…`, or *give one* in
Admin → People); every write is then checked against the role that token
belongs to, and the trail records the credential rather than whatever the
request claimed. A fleet that belongs to an organization **auto-enables a
panel token** — without one there is nothing to check, so everybody would
resolve to the owner and the roles would govern nothing. With no organization created, nothing asks you for
permission — which is the right behaviour for one person on one machine.
(`tests/test_rbac.py`)

**⌘K / Ctrl-K** opens the command palette: every action in one searchable
list, each showing the equivalent CLI command, so the panel teaches the
terminal instead of hiding it.

On a phone the same panel becomes a bottom-nav app: single column, full-screen
dialogs, 40 px targets.

| `python routines.py save <task-id> --every-days 1` | turn a finished task into a standing arrangement |
| `python reconciler.py add\|list\|tick\|pause\|resume\|remove\|status` | keep a declared state true with a PROVEN procedure, model-free: observe, restore, re-observe, back off, halt to you when it cannot converge (docs/DESIGN-P9a) |
| `python watchdog.py status\|evaluate\|enter\|clear` | fault protection: declared limits (`[agent.watchdog]`) with one response, safe mode — no task claimed, a running task stopped at its step boundary, invariants kept — that only you clear, with a reason (docs/DESIGN-P9b) |
| `python twin.py consent grant --scope predict\|advise\|draft\|act` | turn the owner's twin on (a sealed, revocable consent chain; off until you do) |
| `python twin.py observe\|import\|harvest\|learn\|predict\|fidelity\|render\|status` | the twin: record a decision, fit the kernel, ask "what would I do?", run the benchmark, see the OWNER block every window reads (docs/DESIGN-P10) |
| `python twin.py shadow [--reveal ID]\|questions\|answer ID --text\|drift status\|confirm\|dismiss` | shadow predictions (sealed before you decide, hidden until you do), the one open "why", and drift — a notice with numbers that only you turn into a new kernel version |
| `python twin.py superself\|draft\|act --done-check CMD` | the Super-Self (needs `[agent.twin] role`): where a better-informed you diverges, as a question; a draft in your voice, never sent; a gated task on your behalf, never executed by the twin |
| `python twin.py interview\|vignettes\|outcome\|consider\|sensitivity\|objectives\|history\|verify\|capture\|routines` | twin depth (docs/DESIGN-P10.1): the cold-start interview and vignettes, outcomes, the alternatives you weigh, the sensitivity simulation, what you are pursuing, the autobiography, signature verification, the work stream and your routines |
| `python checkpoint.py --root <expert>` | resumable long jobs and their progress |
| `python sandbox.py [--run CMD]` | which execution backend is active, and try it |

| `python federation.py card\|peers` | A2A identity and peers |
| `python package.py` | ship a clean zip (no keys, no logs, no contexts) |
| `python demo.py` | the whole platform, keyless, in one run |
| `python preflight.py` | is this installation fit to run unattended? (§17) |
| `python backup.py create\|verify\|restore\|list` | the memory is the asset — back it up and prove the restore |
| `python backup.py push\|pull\|remote-list` | the same archives, on any S3-compatible store (R2, MinIO, B2, AWS) — signed with stdlib SigV4, no dependency |
| `python proof.py [--refresh] [--feature F]` | every capability's proof level, why it holds, and the command that reproduces it; `--refresh` re-runs the covering tests and re-records the evidence |
| `python mission.py new\|show\|meet\|block` | the objective, its success criteria and the evidence behind each |
| `python workers.py add\|list\|choose` | the computers work can run on, and which one a task would use, with the reason |

| `python acquire.py search\|inspect\|install\|test\|promote` | gaining a capability without gaining uncontrolled authority |
| `python frontier.py propose\|falsify\|route\|acquire\|prove\|adopt` | obtaining a tool nobody anticipated: the agent declares a capability and a two-field probe spec, the **platform** writes the probe, and the probe must FAIL before anything is installed |
| `python frontier.py status\|explain\|retire\|reseal\|accept-terms\|run-probe` | what this fleet can do and what it tried and could not; withdrawing a capability, re-sealing its probe (owner-gated), and recording that a human accepted a service's terms |
| `python training.py status\|export\|register\|promote\|rollback` | training data and promotion governance (it does **not** update weights; trajectories are captured by the loop, not by hand) |

| `python evidence.py` | why we believe each system works, and what remains unproven |
| `python mutate_check.py` | break each load-bearing behaviour and confirm the test that claims to cover it goes red — a passing test that would pass anyway measures nothing |
| `python metrics.py [--expert <slug>] [--json]` | the twelve numbers that say whether any of this is working — and the three it refuses to invent |

```

The **student** role is closed-book by construction: the memory router may
only ever remove sources for it, never add — an owner override cannot hand an
examinee its own notes (`tests/test_memory_kinds.py`).

---

## 7. Stop conditions

Every loop is defined by when it stops. Declare it per task:

```
python loop.py add --role practitioner --goal "reconcile the ledger" \
  --stop-criteria "reconciled.csv exists and balances" \
  --max-attempts 2 --max-steps 40 --deadline 2026-09-01T08:00:00
```

The criteria text reaches the model in its first message and survives
compaction inside HARNESS FACTS; deadline/max_steps/max_attempts are enforced
by the harness, and a stop is filed as a `budget` failure with the reason
named (`tests/test_stop.py`).

---

## 8. Wake on an event

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/experts/<slug>/wake \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "price.drop", "payload": {"sku": "A1", "drop": 0.15}}'
```

The payload is written to `events/` and handed to the task as a fenced file —
never as instructions. Arm what should happen with an `event` intention in
the panel (or `prospective.py`), optionally repeating. A wake can also queue
its own gated task directly (`tests/test_wake.py`).

---

## 9. HTTP API

| method | path | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/events` | **live stream** (bearer header; a token in the URL is refused) |
| GET | `/api/system` `/api/feed` `/api/briefing` `/api/doctor` | fleet state, feed, chief briefing, doctor |
| GET | `/api/harness` `/api/readiness` | manifest + contracts, readiness list |
| GET | `/api/experts` · POST | list / create |
| GET | `/api/experts/<s>/tasks` `/tree` `/file` `/settings` `/skills` `/prospective` `/workflows` `/variants` `/approvals` `/models[?profiles=1]` `/harness` `/context[?task=]` `/trace[?task=]` `/routines` `/identity` | everything about one agent |
| POST | `/api/experts/<s>/task` `/goal` `/wake` `/intention` `/workflow` `/variant` `/approval` `/skill` `/routine` `/answer` `/start` `/stop` `/url` `/scan` `/launch` | act |
| PUT | `/api/experts/<s>/identity` · `/api/commons/pins` · `/api/experts/<s>/file` | owner-authored text and uploads |
| GET | `/api/team[?run=<id>&files=1]` · POST | team runs, and one run as a thread |
| POST | `/api/shutdown` | stop the panel and its children |

Everything under `/api` honours `--token` as an `Authorization: Bearer` header. A token in the QUERY STRING is no longer accepted: URLs reach browser history, referrers and logs, which is the wrong place for a credential that grants everything.

---

## 10. Event names in the log and the stream

`task_start` `tool_call` `task_end` `done_refused` `retry_queued`
`retries_exhausted` `escalated` `stop_condition` `approval_required`
`command_refused` `prospective_fired` `chain_queued` `exam_dispatched`
`reexam_queued` `gaps_queued` `skill_status` `failure_recurred`
`gotcha_filed` `premise_warning` `model_routed` `ui_card` `ui_card_invalid`
`tool_results_cleared` `compaction_incomplete` `health_ritual`
`budget_exceeded` `task_cost_ceiling` `provider_failure` `state_corrupt`
`task_unblocked` `agent_start`.

The procedural loop — verified work becoming a reusable procedure, and
that procedure later running instead of a model (§11b):

`trajectory_opened` `trajectory_closed` `trajectory_refused`
`trajectory_close_failed` `procedure_compiled` `procedure_compile_refused`
`procedure_evaluated` `procedure_evaluation_refused` `procedure_route`
`procedure_route_rejected` `procedure_route_skipped`
`scheduler_record_failed`.

---

## 11. Skills: the open format and its trust tiers

A skill is either `skills/<name>.md` (what the Reflector writes) or a folder
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter — the Agent Skills standard,
so skills from the wider ecosystem import directly:

```
python skills.py import ./downloaded/pdf-forms --root experts/<slug>
python skills.py list --root experts/<slug>
python skills.py promote pdf-forms --root experts/<slug>
python skills.py export my-skill --to ./share --root experts/<slug>
```

Three provenance tiers gate what a skill may do:

| tier | how it got here | what it may do |
|---|---|---|
| `own` | written by this expert's Reflector from its own runs | full |
| `owner` | imported and explicitly trusted by you | full, incl. bundled scripts |
| `community` | imported from a third party | injected with a warning banner; **bundled scripts refused** until you promote it |

Independently, the skill **graph** grades every playbook on evidence, and
the bar is CAUSAL: a skill becomes **proven** only when a matched held-out
ablation — the same cases run with and without it, scored by an independent
grader — shows a positive effect, and **quarantined** when one shows harm.
Counting wins promotes nothing, because a skill being loaded when a task
succeeded is not evidence that it caused the success. Run one with
`skills.run_ablation`; until then a skill stays **candidate** however often
it was loaded. Provenance is where it came from; status is what it has
earned (`tests/test_skill_attribution.py`).

## 11b. Turning verified work into a procedure

The loop can convert work it has already done into something it can re-run
without a model. Nothing is automatic: capture is opt-in per task, and the
judge that decides whether a trajectory counts is sealed by you.

```bash
# 1. you seal a mechanical judge — the thing that decides "this worked"
python procedure.py seal-judge --root <expert> --id invoice-judge   --checks '[{"predicate":"file_equals","path":"out/inv.txt","value":"paid"}]'

# 2. queue work that cites it, with the values that make this instance
python loop.py add --role practitioner --goal "settle the invoice"   --root <expert> --judge-id invoice-judge --family invoices   --inputs '{"path":"out/inv.txt","text":"paid"}' --done-check "..."
```

When two accepted trajectories in one family have **different inputs and
different judges**, the loop compiles them into a candidate procedure and
says so in the log (`procedure_compiled`). Identical evidence is refused —
the same job done twice is one piece of evidence, not two.

A candidate is not trusted. It becomes PROVEN only by passing a suite of
fresh instances you sealed, including at least one edge case:

```bash
python procedure.py seal-suite --root <expert> --id invoice-suite --suite suite.json
python procedure.py evaluate --root <expert> --name proc-invoices --suite invoice-suite
```

After that, a matching task with typed inputs runs the procedure directly:
no model call, the task's own gate still decides, and the log records
`procedure_route` with `model_calls: 0`. If the gate refuses the result, the
procedure is recorded as having lost and the task falls through to the
ordinary model path — a procedure never grades itself.

`python metrics.py` reports **Amortization**: earlier versus later model
steps per verified success, per task family, plus the share of verified
successes that took no model step at all. That number is the whole point,
and it is measured rather than asserted.

## 12. Where commands run

`[agent] sandbox = "docker" | "host" | "e2b" | "daytona"`.

**`docker` is the default, and `host` is refused unless you say so.** The
host backend is not isolation: a model-authored process can reach the whole
machine, and a detached child outlives the check that would have caught it.
An owner who genuinely wants it — a trusted development fixture — must write
`allow_unsafe_host = true` beside it, and every refusal names that key. The
shipped `settings.toml` chooses containment; the test fixtures that opt out
each say why in a comment.

`docker` runs each command in a throwaway container at `/work` with
`--network none` by default. If a configured backend is unavailable the
command is **refused** (exit 127) with the reason — it never silently falls
back to your machine. Policy still runs first in every backend
(`tests/test_sandbox.py`).

Commands never receive the harness's credentials. Any environment variable
whose name looks like a secret (`*KEY*`, `*SECRET*`, `*TOKEN*`, `*PASSWORD*`,
`*CREDENTIAL*`, `*AUTH*`, `*COOKIE*`) is withheld from every model-written
command, so `env` cannot leak your keys into a transcript, a file or an HTTP
request. Two escape hatches, both narrow:

* the platform's own helpers get exactly the one key they need, and only for
  that command shape — `ingest.py transcribe` sees `GROQ_API_KEY`, a bare
  `env` sees nothing;
* `[agent] command_env_allow = ["NAME"]` passes one named variable through.

A command killed by the timeout reports the timeout **and** keeps whatever it
printed first (exit 124), because "it hung after writing 900 rows" and
"nothing happened" are different facts (`tests/test_secrets.py`).

## 13. Knowing what it knows: sources, conflicts, standards, self

Feed an expert forty PDFs, ten videos and a pile of posts and they will
contradict each other. Four files per course keep that from turning into
confident nonsense.

| file | what it is | written by |
|---|---|---|
| `courses/<c>/sources.json` | every source with an **authority tier** (1 normative → 4 anecdotal) and why it got it | `sources.py`, automatically at ingestion |
| `courses/<c>/conflicts.md` | every contradiction found, classified and ruled on | `conflicts.py` |
| `courses/<c>/standards.md` | the bar the material demands, append-only and owner-editable | `standards.py --extract` |
| — | the agent's factual self-model, compiled fresh into every window | `selfmodel.py` |

The four verdicts a contradiction can get:

* **authority** — a tier-1 spec outranks a tier-3 blog post; the ruling names
  the source that lost
* **superseded** — 2026 guidance beats 2018 guidance at equal authority
* **context** — both rules hold, under different stated conditions; both are
  kept with their condition
* **contested** — equals, same era, no condition: **no winner**, and
  `conflicts.py --check` refuses any answer that states it as settled

```bash
python sources.py --root experts/<slug> --course design
python conflicts.py --root experts/<slug> --course design --write
python standards.py --root experts/<slug> --course design --extract
python selfmodel.py --root experts/<slug>
```

The panel shows all of it under an agent → **Mind**: *Self-model* (what it has
verified, per course, with exam results and source tiers) and *Knowledge*
(sources by authority, standards, disagreements). A contested point is a red
pill, and clicking a course opens the rulings.

Owner overrides: `python sources.py --course design --set S-3 --tier 1 --why
"this is the published spec"`, or `[agent.source_tier]` in `settings.toml`.
`standards.py --add` writes a rule the material never stated. Extraction never
rewrites a line you wrote, and a contested point can never become a standard.

## 13b. The owner's twin: how YOU decide, measured

`selfmodel.py` tells an agent what *it* has verified. The twin tells every
agent how the person it works for actually decides — learned from your
own decisions, scored in shadow against the ones you make next, versioned
when you change, and read into every window as the **OWNER** block
(docs/DESIGN-P10-twin.md).

It is off until you consent, and consent is a sealed chain, not a setting:

```bash
python twin.py consent grant --scope predict --root experts/<slug>
```

Then it watches what you already do on that expert — every approval you
grant or deny (with your note as the *why*), every steering note, every
answer to a blocked question — and turns each into an attributed episode.
Decisions the platform did not see, you record or import:

```bash
python twin.py observe --root experts/<slug> \
  --situation "supplier offer, 30-day terms" --features '{"risk":0.7,"margin":0.12}' \
  --options "grant,deny" --choice deny --counterpart supplier-x --why "margin too thin"
python twin.py learn --root experts/<slug>        # fit the kernel (deterministic, hashed)
python twin.py fidelity --root experts/<slug>     # the benchmark, held-out rows only
python twin.py predict --root experts/<slug> --situation "..." --options "grant,deny" \
  --features '{"risk":0.9,"margin":0.05}'         # what would I do? — a distribution
```

What you get back is never a verdict: `grant 0.72 · deny 0.19 · ask 0.09`,
the features that drove it, a novelty score, and the label **TWIN — a
computational model of the owner, not the owner**. Below 20 held-out
decisions the benchmark says **INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE** in those words.

The panel (an agent → **Mind** → *Twin*) shows consent, the kernel, the
benchmark, the shadow ledger (a sealed prediction shows its hash and
nothing else until you decide — a shown prediction would contaminate the
signal it is measured against), the one open *why* question, and any
**drift notice**: when your recent decisions fit a different policy than
before, you see both estimates and choose *confirm* (a new kernel version)
or *dismiss* (the old policy stays). Nothing moves the kernel but you.

Scopes nest: `predict` (shadow scoring, "what would I do") < `advise`
(`superself`: a model role thinks as you with more to know, and where it
diverges from the clone you get a policy-update question — the kernel is
never edited by the model) < `draft` (text in your voice, labeled, never
sent) < `act` (queues a *gated* task on your behalf; the twin executes
nothing, and a task without `--done-check` is refused). `revoke` returns
everything to refusal.

**Teach it on day one, and let it watch you work** (docs/DESIGN-P10.1):

```bash
python twin.py interview --root experts/<slug>                 # fourteen questions
python twin.py interview --root experts/<slug> --answer risk "I take reputational risk, never solvency risk."
python twin.py vignettes --root experts/<slug>                 # 24 decision situations
python twin.py vignettes --root experts/<slug> --answer vg-… deny --why "margin too thin"
python twin.py outcome <episode> good --root experts/<slug>    # what a decision led to
python twin.py history --root experts/<slug>                   # who you have been, per the record
```

Answer the same vignette again a month later and the twin measures your
own consistency — the ceiling it scores itself against. To let it watch
how you work, name the sources in `settings.toml` (naming them is the
consent): `capture_history` (your shell history file, stored redacted)
and `capture_dirs` (directories whose edits become events: paths and line
counts, never content). `python twin.py routines` then shows your habits
("after `git commit` you usually `git push`"), and workflow fidelity
joins the benchmark. The Super-Self runs one metered call per `lenses`
entry and a 400-sample sensitivity simulation of your own policy; put
`TWIN_SIGNING_KEY=<secret>` in `agent.env` and every twin output is
HMAC-signed (`python twin.py verify out.json`).

## 14. The design gate

`designcheck.py` is what makes "professional, not generic AI output" a
refusal rather than a wish. It is wired automatically as the definition of
done for any launched deliverable ending in `.html/.htm/.css/.jsx/.tsx/.vue/
.svelte`.

```bash
python designcheck.py out/index.html
python designcheck.py out/ --root experts/<slug> --course design --json
```

It checks contrast against WCAG on every colour pair declared together, one
type and spacing scale, tokens over literals, a real breakpoint, no fixed
width that overflows a phone, the accessibility floor (lang, alt, labels,
focusable controls, landmarks) — and the fingerprints of unconsidered output:
the default indigo/violet palette, emoji as icons, lorem ipsum, everything
centred, stock marketing copy. Blockers fail the gate; warnings are reported.

A course's own numeric standards raise the bar: `R-01 … contrast … 7:1
[check: min_contrast=7.0]` makes the gate demand 7:1 for that course.

The **UI/UX Designer** template (`templates.py`) is the lane: feed it the
references first, then give it screens.

## 15. Troubleshooting

| symptom | what it means / what to do |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap.py` exits 2 | read the numbered list; each line names the ENV var and the fix |
| `VERDICT: 1 PROBLEM(S)` — keys | no provider key yet; `demo.py` still runs keyless |
| tasks queue but nothing happens | the loop is not running: panel → agent → *start loop*, or `python loop.py run --root experts/<slug>` |
| `finish_task REFUSED` | the definition of done did not pass — that is the gate working; read the evidence in the task |
| `sandbox '<b>' unavailable` | the backend named in `settings.toml` is not installed/keyed; fix it or set `sandbox = "host"` |
| a community skill's script is refused | read it, then `python skills.py promote <name>` |
| `APPROVAL REQUIRED (ap-…)` | a destructive MCP tool paused for you: panel → the agent → the approval card |
| pulse says *polling* not *live* | the SSE stream could not stay open (proxy?); the panel falls back to a 6 s poll automatically |
| Windows + OneDrive write errors | every write retries; sandboxes and tests use the system temp dir on purpose |

---

## 16. The test suite is the specification

```
python tests/run_all.py
```

Every claim in this manual is covered by a named acceptance test that runs a
real loop against a scripted provider — no mocking of the harness itself.
`tests/run_all.py` prints each test's own sentence describing what it proved.

---

## 17. Before you run it on real work

```
python preflight.py          # exit 0 ready · 1 risks · 2 blocked
```

`doctor.py` says the software is healthy; `harness.py --check` says the
contracts hold; **`preflight.py` says whether this installation is fit to run
unattended**. It audits spend caps, credential permissions, backups (present,
recent, checksums verified, covering every expert), disk headroom, provider
fallbacks, sandbox choice, harness contracts, CI, and anything waiting on a
human. Every finding names the command that fixes it.

```
python backup.py create --home . --out ../fleet-backups
python backup.py verify <archive>
python backup.py restore <archive> --dest ./restored
```

Backups carry the memory that cannot be re-downloaded — identities, courses,
cited notes, skills, the commons, state, archives — and **never** carry your
keys, so a restore ends by telling you to put them back. Every file is
checksummed; a damaged archive is refused by `restore` and reported as a
blocker by the preflight.

Full operational detail — exposure and access, cost control, the upgrade
procedure, CI, and an incident table — is in
[REFERENCE.md §21](REFERENCE.md#21-running-it-in-production).
